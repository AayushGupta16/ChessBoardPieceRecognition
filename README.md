# ChessBoardPieceRecognition
Program which classifies pieces on the chessboard. Contains incomplete code in generating a FEN representation

The base model is Yolov5 and I utilized transfer learning to train the model for chess peices specifically. 
I used Yolov5 small which had me train 99 epochs.
This repo also contains codes that transforms the chess board into 64 sqaures using OpenCv, however that code is not currently opperations
I will be maintaining the code as I continue to interate the project
